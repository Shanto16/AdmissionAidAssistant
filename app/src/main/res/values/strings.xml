    <string name="nsu_about">North South University (NSU), the first private university in Bangladesh, was established in 1992 by the then
        Foundation for Promotion of Education and Research (FPER), a charitable, non-profit, non-commercial and non-political organization.
        The FPER later was renamed as the NSU Foundation and is presently called The North South Foundation for Education and Research.
        The Foundation is comprised of a group of eminent industrialists, prominent patrons of education, notable philanthropists, widely
        experienced academics and senior civil servants of the country. In the early 1990s, they had a dream to set up a world-class university
        as a center of excellence in higher education in the private sector. Their dedication, tireless efforts, and hard work paved the way for the approval of the establishment of NSU.</string>
